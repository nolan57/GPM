# Gantt Project Management Software (GPM) Completion Plan

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the project, I will develop a detailed completion plan, starting from the basic components and gradually building a complete application.

## Project Overview
This is a Gantt chart project management software built using WPF and the Prism framework, adopting the MVVM architectural pattern. Its main features include project management, task management, plugin system, and time scaling functionality.

## Completion Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Architecture Improvement (1-2 days)

**Task 1: Improve Service Layer Implementation**
- Add complete CRUD operation implementations for `ProjectService`
- Add complete task management functionality for `TaskService`
- Implement data persistence (using Entity Framework Core)

**Task 2: Fix Model Classes**
- Ensure all model class properties are properly initialized
- Add necessary relationship mappings

**Task 3: Optimize Dependency Injection Configuration**
- Ensure all services and view models are correctly registered
- Add view navigation support

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation (3-5 days)

**Task 1: Implement Project Management Features**
- Create project list and detail views
- Implement project creation, editing, and deletion functionality

**Task 2: Implement Task Management Features**
- Create task list and Gantt chart views
- Implement task creation, editing, assignment, and progress tracking
- Add task dependency support

**Task 3: Implement Time Scaling Features**
- Improve `TimeScalingService` implementation
- Add time unit switching functionality (day, week, month, etc.)

### Phase 3: UI Design and Interaction Optimization (2-3 days)

**Task 1: Redesign Main Interface Layout**
- Adopt more reasonable space division
- Add navigation menu

**Task 2: Implement Gantt Chart Visualization**
- Implement Gantt chart based on WPF custom controls or third-party libraries
- Add interactive features (such as task dragging, progress adjustment, etc.)

**Task 3: Optimize User Experience**
- Add responsive design
- Implement data validation and error handling
- Add loading states and operation feedback

### Phase 4: Plugin System Improvement (1-2 days)

**Task 1: Improve Plugin Interface Definitions**
- Add more plugin type support
- Define plugin lifecycle management

**Task 2: Implement Plugin Loading and Management**
- Add dynamic plugin loading functionality
- Implement plugin configuration interface

### Phase 5: Testing and Release (2-3 days)

**Task 1: Unit Testing and Integration Testing**
- Write unit tests for core functions
- Conduct integration tests to ensure modules work together

**Task 2: Performance Optimization**
- Optimize rendering performance with large data volumes
- Reduce memory usage

**Task 3: Documentation and Release Preparation**
- Write user manuals and development documentation
- Prepare installation packages and release notes

## Technical Selection Recommendations

1. **Gantt Chart Implementation**:
   - Consider using free open-source solutions such as components from GanttProject or ProjectLibre
   - Or implement Gantt chart components based on WPF custom drawing

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Use Entity Framework Core to connect to SQLite database (lightweight, no installation required)

3. **UI Framework**:
   - Implement modern UI based on MaterialDesignThemes

4. **Extended Features**:
   - Add export support for formats like PDF, Excel, etc.
   - Implement team collaboration features

By completing the above phases step by step, we will be able to build a fully functional, high-performance Gantt chart project management software.
