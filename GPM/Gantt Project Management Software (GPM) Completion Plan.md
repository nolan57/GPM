          - âœ… Completed basic task bar rendering and layout
          - âœ… Completed: GridLineControl (grid line control)
          - âœ… Completed: ComponentPropertyCustomization (extensive customizable properties for Gantt chart components)
          - ðŸ”„ To be improved: ProgressIndicatorControl (progress indicator control)
          - ðŸ”„ To be optimized: Data binding and MVVM architecture refinement
          - ðŸ”„ To be added: Task bar drag and adjust functionality
       - **Phase 2: Interaction Control and View Container Components (3-4 days)**
         - Implement interaction control components: DragDropController, SelectionController, ScrollController
         - Develop view container components: GanttChartContainer, TaskListPanel, TimeScalePanel

       - **Service Components**: RenderingService, EventService, DataService
       - **Utility Components**: TimeFormatter, ColorProvider, TooltipController
     - **Trade-off Principles**:
       - Functionality over aesthetics: Ensure core features are complete first
       - Custom vs third-party: WPF custom ensures full control but higher development cost
       - Immediate needs vs extensibility: Prioritize current requirements while preserving plugin architecture
       - Modular vs monolithic: Component-based architecture for better maintainability and testability

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Use Entity Framework Core to connect to SQLite database (lightweight, no installation required)
   - Support time scaling region data persistence and management

3. **UI Framework**:
   - Implement modern UI based on MaterialDesignThemes

4. **Extended Features**:
   - Add export support for formats like PDF, Excel, etc.
   - Implement team collaboration features
   - **Time Scaling Components**: Custom implementation for local time period manipulation and multi-level scaling
   - **Dialog and Form Components**: Custom implementation for project creation/editing interface with validation and calendar controls

By completing the above phases step by step, we will be able to build a fully functional, high-performance Gantt chart project management software.
